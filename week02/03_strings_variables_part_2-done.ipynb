Next, he takes a box that Alice send to him alice' public keyand puts the secret key into the box. Now Bob cannot open any of the boxes. He then sends the two boxes to Alice. Alice takes the second box, and sources the key alice' private key to that box. She opens this box, and it contains the key for the first box, and then opens it. She then reads the message, and check the photograph.\n",
